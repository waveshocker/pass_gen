generate password
Password is generated based on user input criteria.
First a numeric length between 8 and 128 has to be selected.
Then the user is prompted to put in y or n for Uppercase, Lowercase, numeric, or special characters.
Based on the user input, a password will be generated with at least one of each of the user selected criterion.
The password is then displayed on the screen.
